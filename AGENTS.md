# Bugbook Repo Instructions

This repo is often worked in a dirty tree. Keep changes narrowly scoped and do not bundle unrelated local work into a ticket commit.

## Before You Claim A Change Is Clean

Run these from `/Users/maxforsey/Code/bugbook`:

```bash
swift build
swift test
bash scripts/smoke-cli.sh
```

If you touched the macOS app shell or AppKit integration, also run:

```bash
cd macos && xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project /Users/maxforsey/Code/bugbook/macos/Bugbook.xcodeproj -scheme BugbookApp -configuration Debug build
```

Do not say "CI passed" unless the commit has been pushed and the GitHub Actions workflow finished successfully.

## Commit Hygiene

- Commit only the files for the accepted ticket or batch.
- Leave unrelated tracked modifications alone unless the user explicitly asks to include them.
- Do not stage local tool folders, generated build output, or workspace-specific metadata.

## CI Notes

- The source of truth for package validation is SwiftPM (`swift build`, `swift test`).
- The macOS Xcode project is generated from `macos/project.yml`.
- If CI is being changed, prefer explicit SDK detection plus real failures over `|| echo` masking.

## Bugbook Ticket Notes

When reading an Agent Ticket body, do not use the raw JSON output directly. Extract only the markdown body:

```bash
bugbook get "Agent Tickets" <row_id> --body | jq -r '.body // ""'
```

This avoids writing serialized row JSON back into the ticket body.
